##### Task details

Visit https://api.giphy.com/ and understand the features it provides.
We are primarily interested in Trending API and GIFS Search API.

Assignment:

Develop a React app that will use these two API to deliver a feature. The app will have just one view.

On loading the view display the top 9 trending GIFs in a 3x3 matrix.
The view should support searching for GIFs.
On successful search the top 9 search result GIFâ€™s should be displayed.
Also, keep a count of number of searches done and show it next to search button.(It need not persist permanently, may start from 0 on server restart)
